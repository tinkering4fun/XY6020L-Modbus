How to use the Modbus Interface of XY6020L **Digital Programmable Power Supply Module**  


Since I couldn't find any documentation on the net, I've compiled this [document](./doc/XY6020L-Modbus-Interface.pdf) with the necessary information to make use of the serial interface and Modbus protocol.  
The module is basically very similar to the DPS5020, but supports a slightly different Modbus register set.  
The data sheet promises an input voltage range of up to 70V and an output capabilty up to **60V** and max. **20A**.

It can also operate in headless mode (no display/panel) and is even cheaper than DPS5020.  
This makes it an ideal candidate for battery charging or solarpanel tracking projects and experiments.
